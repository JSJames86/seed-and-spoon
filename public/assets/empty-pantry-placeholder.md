## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Placeholder Image Required**

The 404 page is currently live but references `/assets/empty-pantry.png` which does not yet exist. The page will function without it, but the image area will show a broken image icon.

### To Add the Image:

1. Create or source an illustration matching the specs above
2. Save it as `empty-pantry.png`
3. Place it in `/public/assets/`
4. Verify it displays correctly by navigating to a non-existent page (e.g., `/test-404`)

## Alternative: Use Emoji or Icon Temporarily

If you need a quick placeholder, you can modify `app/not-found.jsx` to use an emoji or icon instead:

```jsx
{/* Replace the <img> tag with: */}
<div className="mt-6 text-9xl">
  üè™
</div>
{/* or */}
<div className="mt-6 text-9xl">
  üì¶
</div>
```
