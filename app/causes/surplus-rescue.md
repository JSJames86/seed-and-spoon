# Surplus Rescue Program  
### Saving good food. Feeding our neighbors. Respecting the planet.

Every day, perfectly good food gets tossed—not because it’s bad, but because it’s extra.  
Seed & Spoon NJ’s Surplus Rescue Program steps in before that happens. We collect surplus from grocery stores, bakeries, food banks, and local partners, then turn it into fresh meals, grocery boxes, and community meals for families we serve.

## What is Surplus Rescue?

Instead of letting good food go to waste, we redirect it into our community.

Seed & Spoon NJ works with local businesses and organizations that have safe, unsold food—produce, bread, pantry items, and prepared food that can’t be sold in time. Our team safely picks it up, sorts it, and channels it into the programs that feed our neighbors every week.

Surplus Rescue keeps our ingredient costs low, our impact high, and our footprint on the planet lighter.

## Where the Food Comes From

We partner with:

- Grocery stores & supermarkets  
- Bakeries & cafés  
- Food banks with overflow  
- Restaurants & caterers  
- Event spaces with leftover food (still safe to use)

Instead of going to the landfill, this food goes directly into the hands of families.

## How Surplus Rescue Works

1. **Partners Flag Surplus**  
   Stores, bakeries, or food banks contact us when they have safe, unsold food.

2. **Pickup & Safe Handling**  
   Our trained volunteers pick up items using food-safe storage and transport.

3. **Sorting & Safety Checks**  
   Everything is inspected, separated by category, labeled, and prepped for use.

4. **Transformation Into Meals & Boxes**  
   Ingredients are cooked into weekly meals, added to grocery boxes, or used for
   community dinners.

Items we can’t serve are used for compost whenever possible.

## Where the Rescued Food Goes

- **Prepared Meals** for families in our weekly support program  
- **Monthly Grocery Boxes** stocked with produce & pantry staples  
- **Seasonal Community Dinners** (Back to School, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother’s Day, etc.)  
- **Soil & Compost** for farms and gardens when items can’t be served
